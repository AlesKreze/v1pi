What is it?
-----------

It's an image for a raspberry pi, where I've configured as much as possible to help you get started
quickly making things with your v1engineering.com machines.

Safety Notice
-----------

Please be safe. CNC routers, even small ones, with tiny bits can make mistakes, and quickly end up
in a dangerous situation, causing a fire that can quickly grow to serious damage. Don't leave your
machine unattended. I am not responsible for anything you do with this software!

Let's Do It
